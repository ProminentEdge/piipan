Current states in NAC Group 1Â 
------------------------------

After assessing the feasibility of several states that volunteered to be part of the NAC initial rollout, 18F + FNS selected 10 states that were best equipped to integrate the system first. The Group 1 states include three rankings (Group 1A, 1B, and 1C) based on their technical readiness, ability to meet the timeline, available resources, and other criteria.

The four states selected to be part of Group 1A have been working closely with the NAC project team to provide feedback and collaboratively co-design the NAC system so it causes minimal delay and burden on eligibility workers and SNAP recipients. The six states in Group 1B and 1C have also participated in regular check-ins and research sessions with the NAC project team, and are next in line to integrate the NAC after the Group 1A states.

Three of the four states in Group 1A have begun testing the NAC APIs in the test environment and have prioritized integration for a 2022 launch. There will be a phased launch approach, with the remaining seven states in Group 1 launching after the initial three states.
