Status
------

The NAC is currently in pre-release status. Much of the core functionality is demonstrably working. The ATO process is underway but not complete. Three states have started working on integration.

Automated testing has been added to the Continuous Integration pipeline, including Accessibility testing with pa11y-ci. Automated tests currently cover more than 80% of the project code, and 18F anticipates achieving 90% coverage before the vendor team begins work.
